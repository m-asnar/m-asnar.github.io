        <h1>Who am I?</h1>

        <p>Hello there! My name is Manuel Asnar, and these days I spend most of my time working towards a PhD in rock
            physics at the Freie Universität Berlin and at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Potsdam Deutsches GeoForschungsZentrum
            GFZ.
            You would be forgiven for just saying “GFZ”.</p>

        <p>I’m personally interested in investigating the damage and seemingly spontaneous recovery of rocks and other
            similarly behaving materials, a behavior sometimes called non-classical, non-linear elasticity. I do this by
            applying techniques borrowed from ambient noise seismology to continuously monitor velocity changes on rock
            samples as I subject them to varying levels of strain, but also when I don’t.</p>

        <p>I do most of my work under the supervision of <a
                href="https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/staff/christoph.sens-schoenfelder">Christoph Sens-Schönfelder</a>, <a
                href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/audrey-bonnelye-a6a84455/">Audrey Bonnelye</a>, <a
                href="https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/staff/georg.dresen/sec42">Georg Dresen</a> and <a
                href="https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/staff/marco.bohnhoff/sec42">Marco Bohnhoff</a>.</p>

        <p>My PhD is part of the EU Horizon 2020 Seismological Parameters and INstrumentation (SPIN) project, which
            trains a cohort of PhD students all across Europe and aims to deepen our understanding of the potential
            presented by new seismic instrumentation tools.</p>

        <h1>The unprofessional section</h1>

        <h3>Climate awareness</h3>

        <p>I consider myself as someone who is fairly aware of the current state of the climate and our environment in
            general. Although my day-to-day motivation and degree of activism varies depending on my mental state, I
            haven't
            flown since 2019. This has however only been possible thanks to having extensive amounts of travel money
            available, which was unusual even by Western European standards.</p>

        <p>Here is a link to the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf">IPCC
                AR6 Summary for Policymakers</a> for getting up to date quickly on the physics of the whole thing. For
            other more or less entertaning takes on the subject, I invite you to check out basically anything made by
            the inspiring <a href="https://www.amywestervelt.com/">Amy Westervelt</a>, the hilarious <a
                href="https://www.climatetownproductions.com/">Rollie Williams</a> at Climate Town, and academic voices
            such as Peter Kalmus, Gianluca Grimalda, Julia Steinberger, Valérie Masson-Delmotte, Friederike Otto, and
            many others.</p>

        <h3>Great websites</h3>

        <p>I have always had a weakness for old school, slightly outdated, corny academic webpages, even more so when
            they include completely off-topic sections about whatever floats the author's boat, and I certainly intend
            on doing my part to keep this tradition alive. Below are a few interesting specimens from which I have drawn
            inspiration for my personal page.</p>

        <h3>Other hobbies</h3>

        <p>
            I am very into food, although not a fantastic cook myself. Chinese and Italian cuisines are probably my
            favorites at the moment, but I would love to delve deeper into Indian cooking. Most of my free time is
            spent either reading (or watching) stuff about food, playing rugby union (or touch football), reading manga
            (Gantz, One Piece and Vinland Saga being my absolute favorites), or doing what I like to think is my best to
            learn new languages (mostly brushing up on my German and trying to get to a preschooler level in Japanese).
            I am also from the Basque Country, a stunning region overlapping both France and Spain on the Atlantic side
            (so no, it's not Catalunya).
